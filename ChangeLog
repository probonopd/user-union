	* New "-P" option, so users can easily disable redirection for a
	  specific file.

	* Improvements in the man page documentation
	* Eliminated some compiler warnings
	* Fixed space-handling when stacking multiple LD_PRELOAD modules
	  (thanks to Stas Sergeev)
	* Enabled uclibc build (thanks to Stas Sergeev)
	* Added AM_PROG_AR to configure.ac
	  (without this, failed or wrong builds could result)

	* Last-minute improvements for a first public release.
	  - Tarball shouldn't include unnecessary files (e.g., .o/.so).
	  - README should include URL <http://www.dwheeler.com/user-union>.

	* Switched from BSD-new (3-clause) license to MIT license.
	  They aren't much different, but MIT is simpler to understand,
	  and this would make future mergers with auto-destdir easier.

	* Added a lock around initialization, to make sure the library
	  is initialized exactly once without problem if there are threads.
	* Front-ends now "exit 1" if an unknown option is provided,
	  can present some help info on --help, and output error messages
	  to stderr (not stdout).
	* runtest changed so that it doesn't require nonstandard find options.
	  The program fso_stat requires md5sum to be installed, which
	  isn't standard but is available everywhere.
	  We need portable tests so we can test this on various systems!
	* Wrap many more functions.
	* Began implementing the *at functions.  Fedora 14's "ln" command
	  uses "linkat" (older versions didn't use that),
	  so this is not optional when using Fedora's "ln" command.
	* Added "use_override_prefix =" and default to true.
	  This adds additional protection against self-looping.
