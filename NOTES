Notes on user-union

There's lots of literature about union mounts.  For a survey, see:
* "Unioning file systems: Architecture, features, and design choices"
by Valerie Aurora and its successors:

Using LD_PRELOAD and overriding library calls could use better documentation.
Some info is at:

"Fun with LD_PRELOAD" by Kevin Pulo

Intercepting arbitrary functions on Windows, UNIX, and Macintosh OS X platforms (2004)

Some other issues with LD_PRELOAD are noted here:

An interesting example is in "ekam" (reverse make):
http://code.google.com/p/ekam/source/browse/src/intercept.c
and more generally ekam is at: <http://code.google.com/p/ekam>
in particular I liked their approach to using C macros, and they
had some notes on Apple OS X and the *BSDs.
I used some of their macro approach and naming convention, but ended
up writing my own code to do it.
